# Updated Portfolio 👩‍💻🧳

👩‍💻 For this homework I modified the old homework I have build before. The first portfolio I used HTML and Styles CSS, links and style them. 

👩‍💻 This time I have been using a little bit of Bootstrap in this asignment, using the color that I have found on google.com not only from bootstrap. 

👩‍💻 Updated all the page and added my full name, email and phone numbers. Added the links to the first project I have created with my classmates plus the other two homeworks from my github page. 

👩‍💻 For the Github page I have updated with pinned the repositories for the page. Added profile picture, Bio, current location, email and link to my deployed Portfolio page.

👩‍💻 Customize the size of the page for viewing on a different devices. 

👩‍💻 Biside I have updated my resume and Linkedin, links them to the Portfolio page.
